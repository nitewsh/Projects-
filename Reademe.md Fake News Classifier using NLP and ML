This project builds a binary text classification model to distinguish real vs fake news using NLP and machine learning algorithms on selected categories from the 20 Newsgroups dataset.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
Python

Scikit-learn

NLP (TF-IDF Vectorization)

Matplotlib / Seaborn

ðŸ“Œ Highlights
Dataset created using selected "real" and "fake" news categories

Text features extracted using TfidfVectorizer

Two models trained and tuned: MultinomialNB and LogisticRegression

Evaluation based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUC
