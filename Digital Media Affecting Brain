This deep learning project predicts whether a person frequently feels depressed or down using survey responses. It handles imbalanced data using SMOTE, focal loss, and K-Fold cross-validation.

 Dataset
Custom survey-based dataset: smmh.csv

Target:
18. How often do you feel depressed or down?
Encoded as:

1: Feels down (score between 3–5)

0: Otherwise

⚙ Pipeline Overview
 Preprocessing
One-hot encoding for categorical features

SMOTE for balancing classes

RobustScaler → QuantileTransformer → PowerTransformer for normalization

PCA for dimensionality reduction (98% variance retained)
